# 🃏 Card Battle – iOS App

Developed by **Daniel Sela**

A classic card battle game (“War”) reimagined for iOS! In each round, the player and the computer reveal one card—whoever has the higher value earns a point. The game runs for 10 rounds, but if there's a tie, the battle continues until there's a clear winner.
