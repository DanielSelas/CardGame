# Card Game – Daniel Sela

A modern, animated, and sound-enhanced iOS **Card Game** built in Swift using UIKit.  
The game simulates the classic "War" card game: in each round, both the player and the PC draw a card — the higher card wins the round. First to win more rounds out of 10 is the winner.  
In case of a tie after 10 rounds, the game continues until there is a clear winner.
